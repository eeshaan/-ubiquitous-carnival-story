Jimmy couldn't escape the carnival.

He got ready for work in his distorted mirror and had deep-fried twinkies for breakfast.
He left his funhouse and got into his bumper car.
The blue sky was cotton candy, and the clouds were ice cream.

Jimmy walked over to the window and reflected on his picturesque surroundings.
The clouds danced like walking foxes. Then he saw something in the distance,
or rather someone.

See the truth of the matter was that his life was the carnival. Everyone around
him seemed to wear masks. The world spun dizzyingly around him, so that when
he walked, he stumbled. But at this moment, everything stilled and he could see 
face of the girl clearly... 

Jimmy had never felt this way before. It was as if his view focused only on 
her and nothing else. "Can I help you?" she said with a strange look. "Yes...
I think you can." This could be where things could finally look up for 
Jimmy.
