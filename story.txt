Jimmy couldn't escape the carnival.

He got ready for work in his distorted mirror and had deep-fried twinkies for breakfast.
He left his funhouse and got into his bumper car.
The blue sky was cotton candy, and the clouds were ice cream.

Jimmy walked over to the window and reflected on his picturesque surroundings.
The clouds danced like walking foxes. Then he saw something in the distance,
or rather someone.
